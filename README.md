Here is the code for the Nasa Space Apps 2019 challenge.
In order to run the app and train the Neural Network, you can download the dataset here:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=15nKAmnpCJvVFfVaPE_lVJ69paJH9D4XN

And put it inside the ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks folder.
Run the training of the network with:
  ```
  python3 cnn.py
  ```
And then run the app with:
  ```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  ```
  python3 app.py
  ```

If you would like to run the app using our pretrained network, you can download
the model file from:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QsRhEOyVdDNPvNJsYaw4J7gvFu7oCexo

And put it inside the ServeModel/models folder. And then run the app:

  ```
  python3 app.py
  ```
